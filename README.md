# libgramas

Library for things I can't be bothered to rewrite every time I write a new C project.

Useful stuff:
  - Buffer to hexadecimal.
  - Command line argument parsing. I am aware GNU has it covered, but I want it natively on Windows too.
  - A horribly buggy hash-table.
  - A horribly buggy pointer array.
